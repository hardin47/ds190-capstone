# Agenda 9/2/25

1. Communicating
2. Presenting
3. Referencing


# Writing up the project

## Work habits

* Start writing today
* Think of it as a long-term relationship (or arranged marriage)
* Write things up as you go, every week

## How to write technically

```{r fig.cap = "Halmos, Paul R. (1970). How to Write Mathematics. L’Enseignement Mathématique, 16(2), 123–152.", fig.alt = "Introduction of the article by Paul Halmos called How to Write Mathematics.", preview = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("halmostitle.jpg")
```

knitr::include_graphics("halmos1.jpg")
```

## Something to say

* An algorithm, visualization, theory, application that excites you.
* Why is it interesting?
* Context
    - What is the history of the idea?
    - Why is it important?
    - What have other people done?
    - What are the open problems?
* What is the **story** you want to tell?

## Someone to say it to

* Your peers
* You, months earlier, in August 2025
* Maybe your adviser(s)
* People unconnected to but interested in the project

## Important rules

* Distinguish clearly between formal content and informal content
* Formal content must be correct (e.g., methods)
* Informal content should be helpful (e.g., toy examples)

* Make the reader aware of the status of any part of the text
   - Is it formal or informal?
   - Which part is already known? Which part is your (novel) contribution?
   - The reader should not be in doubt (nor should you be)
   

# Presentations

## The main challenges: the audience

* The audience doesn't have the right background.
* The audience doesn't know what to expect.
* The audience has not been thinking about similar topics.

::: {.callout-important}
You have 10 / 20 minutes to get their attention and talk to them about how cool your project is.
:::

## The importance of examples

* Every complicated idea should have an example to go with it.
* Examples should be very concrete. Use pictures, actual numbers, etc.
* Examples can even come **before** the complicated idea.
* Carry one or two examples through your talk and keep coming back to the same example(s).

::: {.callout-important}
A good concrete example is the lifeline that the audience can hang on to for the duration of the talk. **Finding a good example is hard work** and it can make or break a talk.
:::

## Presentation to-do list

* Know what you are talking about.
* Don't wing it.
* Practice... several times... in a realistic environment.
* Cover less. Don't try to do too much. You are not going to be able to cover every single aspect of your project.

## Content: your main task

* What is the problem you are working on?
* You want everyone to understand...
    - the setup,
    - the main concepts,
    - the main question, and
    - possibly some of the answers.

::: {.callout-important}
The write-up is different than the presentation.  The presentation often covers the same ground as the *introduction* and the *conclusion* of your write-up.

## Things to avoid in a presentation

* Do not provide any detailed derivations
* Avoid jargon, use descriptive and concrete language to say things. Only define terms that you absolutely need for your talk.
* Avoid unnecessary generalizations, be as concrete as possible.


::: {.callout-important}
Your audience will not get hung up on some small detail of the work that is driving you bonkers.
:::


## The slides

* write less, no complete sentences
* use bullets and graphics
* include key ideas and phrases so that the audience doesn't have to catch every word that you *say*
* one idea per slide is a good yardstick
* don't jump back and forth
* slow down
* keep ideas simple

## The talk

* don't speed up
* practice the beginning several times, the first 5 minutes is the most crucial, and it is when you are most nervous
* repeat key ideas. repeat key ideas. repetition is good.
* be clear if you are going on a tangent
* don't change plans in the middle of the talk
* if nervous, pick a friendly face in the audience, and talk to them


# BibTeX

BibTeX is a brilliant way for working with sources. I'm going to show you how to use it in Quarto (Quarto supports literate programming in R, Python, SQL, and many other languages).


## BibTeX file

* text file (no formatting) with a .bib extension
* each entry is a reference
* can include as many entries as you like, even if you don't end up using all the sources


## BibTeX entries

`@article{tukey1972,`  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `author="J. Tukey",`  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `title="Data analysis, computation, and mathematics",`  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `journal="Quarterly of Applied Mathematics",`  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `volume=30,`   
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `pages="51-65",`   
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `year=1972}`  

Somewhere within your Quarto document you’ll have: `@tukey1972` or maybe `[@tukey1972]`


## BibTeX entries

You'll use lots of different BibTeX options:

* `@article`
* `@book`
* `@conference`
* `@inbook`
* `@techreport`
* `@unpublished`

## Formatting

Formatting the entries will be done in the Quarto YAML

## See example

* <a href = "https://ds190-capstone.netlify.app/slides/bibtex_example.qmd" target = "_blank">`bibtex_example.qmd`</a>
* <a href = "https://ds190-capstone.netlify.app/slides/capstone.bib" target = "_blank">`capstone.bib`</a>


## Next up

* September 9, data science ethics from a historical lens.  Two really good pre-readings!

* September 16 + 23 -- first presentations!!!  
   - ~10 min each  
   - 5 or 6 people presenting on each day
   - use Quarto, Google slides, whatever
