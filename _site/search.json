The capstone project is outside of statistics, mathematics, and computer science, emphasizing work in aligned disciplines. The students will bring together the work they have done in data scienc with problems in other disciplines, and they will consider the ethical implications of their questions and their work. Prerequisite: all DS minor core courses including statistics, linear algebra, computer science, data science, and ethics in data science.\nAnonymous Feedback As someone who is constantly learning and growing in many ways, I welcome your feedback about the course, the classroom dynamics, or anything else you’d like me to know. There is a link to an anonymous feedback form on the landing page of our Canvas webpage. Please provide me with feedback at any time!\n\n\n\n\nStatistical & Computational Proficiency: Students will develop expertise and apply their knowledge in statistical analysis, probability, and computational concepts relevant to data science, including efficiency and data structures.\nApplication of Computational Methods: Students will demonstrate the ability to apply algorithmic, mathematical, and scientific reasoning to computational problems using a programming language.\nEthical Decision-Making: Students will understand and practice ethical philosophies and frameworks for data-driven decision-making and evaluating scientific claims.\nEffective Communication: Students will clearly and persuasively communicate data-driven analyses using literate programming and collaborate effectively with stakeholders across disciplines.\n\n\n\n\n\ncarry out a study and communicate results from an extensive data-driven project that is related to domain specific challenges; and\ndemonstrate competency in applying at least one type of advanced data-analytic method such as (not limited to):\n\nmodeling a process (e.g., generalized linear models, Bayesian analysis, advanced probability theory and stochastic processes, non-linear models, machine learning, big data analysis, econometrics, or statistical computing)\nadvanced study-design (e.g., creating a computational online study with sophisticated design to deal with non-independence)\nadvanced data visualization (e.g., creating a dashboard)\nadvanced computational data curation (e.g., scraping multiple websites and using regular expressions); and\n\nbe written with scripting code (i.e., not pull-down menus) using literate programming (data + code + results + narrative) and version control (e.g., GitHub); and\nfocus on a question originating from or responding to a domain outside of statistics, mathematics, and computer science.\n\n\n\n\n(adapted from Monica Linden, Brown University):\nIn an ideal world, science would be objective. However, much of science is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of privileged voices. In this class, we will make an effort to recognize how science (and statistics!) has played a role in both understanding diversity as well as in promoting systems of power and privilege. I acknowledge that it is possible that there may be both overt and covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even though the material is primarily of a scientific nature. Integrating a diverse set of experiences is important for a more comprehensive understanding of science. I would like to discuss issues of diversity in statistics as part of the course from time to time.\nPlease contact me if you have any suggestions to improve the quality of the course materials.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records, please let me know!\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. You can also relay information to me via your mentors. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the math liaisons, Dean of Students, or QSC staff are all excellent resources. I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn class we’ll mostly be discussing the readings (which can be found in the course schedule.) You will each be responsible for leading the class on two different occasions: once to contextualize the readings and once to lead a discussion on the readings. You are welcome to run the class in any of a variety of formats (i.e., putting students in groups to brainstorm, asking each student to respond to a question, asking provocative questions, etc.) It will be very helpful for you to talk with me before your assigned day so that we can devise a strategy and a set of topics/questions for your discussion. We will not discuss every word that you read, but you should complete all the readings (some of which will be used in the papers) and be prepared to discuss them.\nEven if you are not assigned to lead a discussion, you will be expected to participate and contribute to the discussion every day. Class attendance is required. Your comments in class will be evaluated on how well they demonstrate familiarity with the reading and how they acknowledge and promote discussion by others. If you are one of the more talkative students, try to encourage others to contribute as well. If you have an idea that is somewhat off topic, write it down, and we’ll come back to it. Let’s try to keep the discussions moderately linear and on-topic.\n\n\n\n\nAs you know, this course has a large writing component. The majority of your grade will come from the writing you do. You will write 2 formal papers and a research paper. Additionally, there will be assigned weekly informal writings.\nformal essays will be turned in as a micro-essay, then a final version, then a rewrite of the final version. Two of your peers, Chris, and I will give you comments on your paper; remember, our comments will never be entirely comprehensive and can only be as helpful as your paper is good. For example, if your final version of the paper is difficult to read because it is full of grammatical errors, we may comment mostly on those. If the rewrite fixes all of the grammatical errors, the paper still may receive a “C” grade due to poor understanding of the paper topic (on which we were unable to comment for the first paper because of the grammatical errors).\nPapers should be in 12-point font, have one-inch margins, and be double spaced. Include your name, the date, the course, and a title on every paper. Do not include a separate title page. Instructions for how / where / when to turn in papers is on the assignments page.\nresearch paper will include library research and primary sources. More later.\nmicro-essays will be assigned regularly as short (500 words) reflections on some aspect of the readings from class. You should feel free to be creative and to stretch out of your comfort zone when thinking about the readings and writing your reflections. The grades for the informal writings will be given based on effort and participation.\n\n\n\nThere will be a substantial amount of reading in this class (see the schedule). The source of the readings are:\n\nSakai – most of your readings will be available electronically via Sakai.\nElectronic Journals – some of your readings will be available online via the library’s electronic journal database. This database is fairly straightforward to search, but you will also get an orientation to this and other databases on your library orientation day.\nElectronic sources - some of the readings are hyper-linked from the schedule page. If you use the sources in your writing, be sure to investigate proper citation methods.\n\n\n\n\nThe Writing Center is open this semester! They open at full capacity after the second week of the semester, but they will be holding limited hours as soon as classes begin. Writing and Speaking Partners meet one-on-one with students to talk about their work and provide feedback at any stage of their preparation process. Trained to think deeply about rhetoric and communication across the curriculum, these student peers facilitate conversations about everything from ID1 papers to senior theses, lab reports to creative writing, giving presentations to developing strategies for reading and engaging more deeply in class discussions.\nAdditionally, Jenny Thomas, the Assistant Director of College Writing and Language Diversity, offers specialized writing and speaking support for multilingual students navigating English as an additional language.\nTo make an appointment with a Writing or Speaking Partner, please log on to the Portal and go to Academics &gt; Writing Center, or contact them at writing.center@pomona.edu. All appointments will be made through the Portal as usual, and the meetings will be online–or sometimes in-person but outdoors. The Writing and Speaking Partners will be flexible both about the mode of consultation (phone, Zoom, email, Google docs, walk and talk, etc.) and about their hours in order to accommodate student needs.\n\n\n\nThe Claremont Colleges Library provides a welcoming space for students to get help on their research assignments, from theses and dissertations, to papers, to multimedia projects. Librarians are available to work with students in any discipline at any stage of the research process, including narrowing down a topic, locating and using resources, or creating a formatted reference list. Even if you are an experienced researcher, you can still benefit from working with a librarian: your librarian can introduce you to ideas, perspectives, or resources you haven’t yet considered. You will find working with a librarian to be most valuable earlier in your research process than the night before your assignment is due - the earlier the better!\nGeneral research appointments or subject specific research appointments are available for all students at point in your project. In addition, you can get support through the Student Assisted Research Support, available through chat, Mondays-Fridays. Check the library’s website for up-to-date hours.\nOne other library resources is their subject specific Research Guides.\n\n\n\nYou are on your honor to present only your work as part of your course assessments. That is, you should be writing your own words and doing your own analyses as part of the capstone. It should be your work, not ChatGPT’s. That said, you should feel free to ask ChatGPT for clarification on a topic you don’t understand, to ask what a particular error message means, or to ask whether what you’ve written makes sense. But don’t have ChatGPT do the coding or the analysis for you. I mean, if you do that, why are you even trying to get the minor?\nBelow, I’ve provided Pomona’s academic honesty policy which is available in the Student Handbook. But before the policy, I’ve given some thoughts on cheating which I have taken from Nick Ball’s CHEM 147 Collective (thank you, Prof Ball!). Prof Ball gives us all something to think about when we are learning in a classroom as well as on our journey to become scientists and professionals.\nThere are many known reasons why we may feel the need to “cheat” on problem sets or exams:\n\nAn academic environment that values grades above learning.\nFinancial aid is critical for remaining in school that places undue pressure on maintaining a high GPA.\nNavigating school, work, and/or family obligations that have diverted focus from class.\nChallenges balancing coursework and mental health.\nBalancing academic, family, peer, or personal issues.\n\nBeing accused of cheating – whether it has occurred or not – can be devastating for students. The college requires me to respond to potential academic dishonesty with a process that is very long and damaging. As your instructor, I care about you and want to offer alternatives to prevent us from having to go through this process. If you find yourself in a situation where “cheating” seems like the only option:\nPlease come talk to me. We will figure this out together.\nPomona College is an academic community, all of whose members are expected to abide by ethical standards both in their conduct and in their exercise of responsibilities toward other members of the community. The college expects students to understand and adhere to basic standards of honesty and academic integrity. These standards include, but are not limited to, the following:\nHere are fun academic honesty tutorials & quizes you could work through to test your knowledge.\nPlease be sure to read Pomona’s Policies on Academic Integrity. Additional information on citation, summarizing, and working with others so that you can successfully maintain academic integrity.\n\n\n\nYour final grade will be calculated as follows."

However, much of science is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of privileged voices. In this class, we will make an effort to recognize how science (and statistics!) has played a role in both understanding diversity as well as in promoting systems of power and privilege. I acknowledge that it is possible that there may be both overt and covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even though the material is primarily of a scientific nature. Integrating a diverse set of experiences is important for a more comprehensive understanding of science. I would like to discuss issues of diversity in statistics as part of the course from time to time.\nPlease contact me if you have any suggestions to improve the quality of the course materials.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records, please let me know!\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. You can also relay information to me via your mentors. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the math liaisons, Dean of Students, or QSC staff are all excellent resources. I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

This year we are gathering in person for what we do best: create, generate, and share knowledge. During the past academic year, we built community remotely, and this year we will build on the pedagogical improvements we acquired last year. For example, we might meet on zoom from time to time, or hold discussions online on Sakai Discussions Board.\nOur health, both mental and physical, is paramount. We must consider the health of others inside and outside the classroom. All Claremont Colleges students have signed agreements regulating on-campus behavior during the pandemic; in the classroom, we will uphold these agreements. We need to take care of each other for this course to be successful. I ask you therefore to adhere to the following principles:\n\nThere is a mask mandate for all indoor spaces on campus. You must wear a mask for the entire class; eating and drinking are not permitted. Your mask must cover your mouth and nose. The college has zero-tolerance for violations of this policy, and our shared commitment to the health and safety of our community members means if you come to class unmasked you will have to leave class for the day.\nClass attendance is required, but if you need to miss class for health reasons, concerning symptoms, suspected Covid exposure, unexpected dependent care, technology issues, or other emergency reasons I will work with you. Let me underscore this: please make your decisions always based on health, safety, and wellness—yours and others—and I will work with you at the other end. Take any potential symptoms seriously; we’re counting on each other.\nWhen not in class, avoid closed public spaces, and if you can’t avoid them: wear your mask properly, wash your hands, and maintain social distance.\nIf you, or a family member, are experiencing hardship because of the pandemic, talk to me or to someone in the Dean of Students office. You are not alone during this time.\n\nThe pandemic is fast-moving, and we might have to adjust the principles as the semester evolves. I am always happy to receive your feedback to make this course work.\nLet’s care for each other, show empathy, and be supportive. While there will likely be some community transmission and breakthrough infections, together, we can minimize their effect on our community and on your learning."

The research question will continue to evolve over the life of the project, but you should keep coming back to the (evolving) idea you want to argue. The third essay will be a research paper describing how statistics (as a discipline, as a set of data analysis tools, as individual people, etc.) are/were involved in creating or reinforcing systemic inequality or social injustice. In addition to a succinct and arguable thesis statement, your essay should include:\n\nThesis statement somewhere early on and clear to your reader.\nDetails of the event / person / tool of interest.\nHistorical context (why the thing you describe happened / was able to happen).\n\n(Optional) You might also give the reader an idea of possible solutions (how to make it better) or maybe a counter argument.\nA potential audience for your essay is a STEM undergraduate who feels disempowered by the traditional canon. If your essay speaks to a different audience, please talk to me before turning in your assignments.\n\n\nIdeas for getting started include:\n\nSome of the founders of the field of statistics were eugenicists. For example, you might start by reading about the journal Nature’s reckoning with their own history supporting eugenics: How Nature contributed to science’s discriminatory legacy, September 2022.\nOriginal medical studies were done (almost) entirely on white men.\n23 & me has information primarily on white, thin, high income Americans. https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/freakonomics-radio/id354668519?i=1000438218337\nContributions to the field of statistics that were by individuals in marginalized roles were attributed to white men.\nCorollary: because science is dominated by white men, data exist primarily on their contributions. Thus, contributions by non-white men get overlooked. Recently (10/2/2018), Donna Strickland was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. Just a few months prior (5/23/2018) Wikipedia refused to allow her page to be created. As reported in The Atlantic, ” ‘This submission’s references do not show that the subject qualifies for a Wikipedia article.’ Strickland, it was determined, had not received enough dedicated coverage elsewhere on the internet to warrant a page.” https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/10/nobel-prize-physics-donna-strickland-gerard-mourou-arthur-ashkin/571909/ [The problem here is about human influence into data and algorithms.]\nThe larger issue: current algorithms and AI protocols reinforce existing structures and are often biased against marginalized communities. (Summary and ideas here: https://www.infoq.com/presentations/unconscious-bias-machine-learning.)\nStatistical models were used as part of redlining.\nTuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male or Willowbrook Study.\nCollider bias, e.g., see “Why Statistics Don’t Capture the Full Extent of the Systemic Bias in Policing” by Laura Bronner, https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-statistics-dont-capture-the-full-extent-of-the-systemic-bias-in-policing/\nUsing “statistics” to show connections between race and disease sets up a structure of biological differences instead of focusing on systemic disparities in healthcare and other socio-economic factors. See “Racial Health Disparities and Covid-19 – Caution and Context” in New England Journal of Medicine https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2012910.\nStatistical models used to argue biological determinism (e.g., see The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould and related controversy … http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001071 and http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/06/did_stephen_jay_gould_fudge_hi.html )\nIf scientific knowledge, data-based arguments, and logical & critical reasoning are sound ways of discovery, why were some of the statistics (STEM generally) founders so prone to racist / misogynist / ableist / etc. ideas? That is, what can we know from science and what can we never know from science?\nWeapons of Math Destruction (Cathy O’Neil) are 1. opaque, 2. at a large scale, 3. destructive.

    "text": "Some General Thoughts on Writing1\n\nIntroduction\nYour task is to describe the main topic you plan to tackle in your formal paper. It should be specific enough to identify your paper (meaning that saying you intend to write about monkeys typing great works of literature is too general), but of course cannot contain all the arguments that your paper will contain.\nIt is common for (academic) writers to write their introductions last, after they had completed the rest of the text. The reasoning behind that is quite logical: one should know what is being introduced well if the introduction is to be effective. You might find it useful to brainstorm and jot down outlines of your entire paper, highlighting the specific topics you’ll deal with, the progression of ideas, the conclusion, etc., all before you write the abstract.\nYou might also find it useful to consult the readings. Naturally, your topic should be selected from the texts we have read so far. The following is a list of questions you can ask yourself about the introduction / ideas for the essay you are writing.\n\nIs the basic idea or insight a good one?\nIs it supported by logical reasoning or valid argument?\nIs it supported by evidence and examples?\nIs there a clear point of view (thesis!!)?\nDoes the idea answer the question / address the topic?\nIs the idea succinct enough for the audience and purpose?\nAre there mistakes in grammar, usage, spelling, or typing?\nIs the tone or formality appropriate?\n\n\n\nFormal Paper Guidelines\n\nbasic structure: If you’ve never written such scholarly papers before–and I’m not assuming you have–then you might find the following general guidelines helpful. If on the other hand you are comfortable with the format, and you are confident of your ability to produce a cohesive, coherent paper while riffing on a theme, you can certainly vary the approach.\n\nintro-body-conclusion. Try dividing your paper into an introductory paragraph which motivates the topic, and which ends with a very clearly stated thesis; a body which discusses, elaborates on and elucidates the thesis; and a concluding paragraph which, instead of just repeating what was said in the paper, continues the topic in a different-but-related direction, leaving the reader intrigued and thinking.\n\n\nmain body. Your paper will probably read more clearly if you restrict your ideas to one per paragraph. (It is easy for the reader to get thrown off if there’s a change of subject that happens from one sentence to the next), and if the first sentence of each paragraph gives the reader a good idea of what that paragraph is about, even better. HOWEVER, each of the ideas in the main body should build on one another (test: if you can rearrange your paragraphs in any order, they aren’t building on one another).\n\n\ntone. With a formal paper, it is a good idea to avoid casual-speak, first person narratives, contractions, and other informalities.\n\nguidelines: Try to think about the essay questions in a new light. That is, feel free to use/connect some of the ideas we’ve talked about in class, but don’t just rehash one idea that we talked about for an entire hour. For example, a paper on the difference between chance and fate won’t be particularly interesting given how much we’ve already discussed it. Three important aspects to a paper include:\n\nthesis: your paper should have a well defined thesis that you can argue using material from the readings.\n\n\nsense of transition between paragraphs: one easy way to make your paper flow is to make ensure that paragraphs flow seamlessly into one another.\n\n\nactive citation: for every claim / idea, you should be able to back-up your statement. Sometimes you’ll need a quote from the text (especially if we’re writing about literature); sometimes you’ll need a reference to a non-fiction source that won’t be quoted.\n\n\n\n\nInternet References\nThe case of internet references requires a special mention. Google can be a very useful tool if you do not know, say, what a run-batted-in is, or what heuristics means, or what happens in the play Hamlet. However, it is difficult to distinguish between scholarly work (that has been edited and peer-reviewed, verified and error-checked) and the website of an aficionado made up of very liberal borrowing from other un-cited sources. Most web references (certainly including Wikipedia) are not appropriate for a formal paper, and I would strongly advise against them.\n\n\nOn Rewrites\nAs a follow up to the personalized feedback you got (or will get) on your formal paper, below are a few more general thoughts.\n\nthesis: Your thesis statement should be interesting and arguable. Be very careful not to simply summarize the chronology of the text. You should be expressing your personal insight. If you are having trouble, try reading against the grain.\nsentence level. When you are writing, and more importantly, when you are reading what you’ve written, pay attention to run-on, fragmented sentences like this one that are awkward, contain too many ideas and could be chopped up and rearranged, and also to meaningless or repetitive statements like “Tversky and Kahneman discuss psychological aspects of randomness in their paper ‘Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.’” Also take heed of excessive verbiage lest you insinuate what you do not signify–if you’re not sure what a given word means, look it up! Don’t choose big words unless there’s a good reason to use them. Finally, avoid using commas to suggest, pauses in the conversation.\nparagraph level. If you stick to one topic per paragraph, you are more likely to end up with a clear paper whose ideas are easily understood by the reader. While you certainly wish to transmit complex ideas, you do not want complicated ideas to arise because your prose keeps switching trains of thought.\npaper level. Paper level problems can also be concerns of focus. Ask yourself what each paragraph is about, and how it relates to your thesis. Keep in mind that an ambitious thesis can be very specific (in fact, it is nearly impossible to properly address a general thesis topic in anything less than a book-length exposition!). The writing center can be very helpful in organizing your ideas in a clear and convincing manner. I also recommend a brainstorming exercise during which you write down very broad-strokes ideas related to your thesis and then schematically connect them; ask me for more details if you’re interested.\n\n\n\nGeneral Suggestions\n\nedit your paper. Try reading your paper out loud to yourself to catch errors.\navoid truisms. Some statements can be at once hollow and impossible to prove, disprove or even discuss. For instance, I can safely discard the statement “as cultures change, so do the people in those cultures” from my exposition without loss of meaning!\nbe specific at the sentence level. “Over time, the availability of different types of food has increased.” Reading this, I find myself asking about the time frame, the people who are consuming the food, the types of food, and the quantities. Sure, if I dig in a bit deeper, I might divine from context. But why make your reader work for their money? Why not deliver the full impact up front?\nMaybe you mean, “During the post-war years between 1948 and 1953, middle-class American housewives saw an increase in the variety and quantity of processed staples like cake mixes and powdered mashed potatoes available in supermarkets.”\npossessive pronouns and apostrophes. “who’s” always means “who is.” “it’s” always means “it is.” The possessive forms of the pronouns “who” and “it” are “whose” and “its.” While we’re here: “whom” is used instead of “who” when the pronoun is an object (of a verb or preposition).\nreferences. Very Important: when quoting directly from a text or else summarizing an idea that you read there, you absolutely must cite that reference. Technically, not citing can constitute plagiarism. Pretty please, be careful! [Though if you are simply discussing the plot of the book (without a quote), and you’ve already told me which book it is, you don’t need to cite the action you describe.]\nalways use the present tense when writing about literature. That’s because the characters will continue to perform the same acts throughout time.\none topic per paragraph. If you change topics in mid-paragraph, you will likely confuse your poor reader. Don’t think of “topic” in very general terms like “statistics” or “randomness.” These are themselves problematic and can create problems on the paragraph level.\ntry very hard to avoid “this/these/those” in formal writing. Though sometimes the “this” is clear from your text, more often than not, it isn’t. And we’re back to: why make your reader work for their money? After you’ve written your paper, go back and search for “this” in the paper. Every time you find one, try to replace the word to make its meaning more clear."
