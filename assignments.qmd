    Assignments are an important part of the capstone project. Staying on top of completing the assignments is the key to your success. All assignments should be done with literate programming, compiled to pdf, and submitted on Canvas. Grading will be done using a "reasonable person" test. That is, if a reasonable person would think your annotated bibliography is an annotated bibliography, you will get full credit.

## capstone topic (5 pts)

In one or two paragraphs, explain the topic of your capstone project. The write-up need not be technical and should be accessible to other data science minors (even if they have not had the same
course background as you). 

For the first draft, clearly and precisely spell out both the **data** aspect of your project as well as the **advanced data-analytic method** you will incorporate. Eventually the capstone topic draft will turn into the introduction for your final write-up. At that point (but not for the first draft), it will include an explanation of the scope of the project, and its value, as well as a short introduction to the sources. It will also include definitions of technical terms needed to understand your project.

## annotated bibliography (5 pts)

A list of relevant sources (at least 3), preceded by one or two paragraphs explaining which are the main sources and what you will be doing with each.

## 1st outline (5 pts)

A tentative outline of the titles of the major sections of your capstone project and a (short) narrative explaining what is going to go in each section.

## section draft (5 pts)

One section of your capstone project. You might turn in a full section of your capstone or you might turn in, for example, a well-described analysis that you've done.


## introduction or 2nd section (5 pts)

Revise, expand, and complete either the introduction or the previous section. Now include a title page, the section titles (from your outline), one completed section, and a bibliography.

## ethics component (5 pts)

A description of ethical challenges and how you've addressed them in your capstone project. 


## project draft (10 pts)

Using literate programming, your draft write-up should include an introduction, contextualization (e.g., literature review, background of problem, etc.), description of the data, well-described analysis, ethics challenges / solutions, and conclusion.

## final write-up (25 pts)

Using literate programming, your final write-up should include an introduction, contextualization (e.g., literature review, background of problem, etc.), description of the data, well-described analysis, and conclusion.
