The capstone project is outside of statistics, mathematics, and computer science, emphasizing work in aligned disciplines. The students will bring together the work they have done in data scienc with problems in other disciplines, and they will consider the ethical implications of their questions and their work. Prerequisite: all DS minor core courses including statistics, linear algebra, computer science, data science, and ethics in data science.\nAnonymous Feedback As someone who is constantly learning and growing in many ways, I welcome your feedback about the course, the classroom dynamics, or anything else you’d like me to know. There is a link to an anonymous feedback form on the landing page of our Canvas webpage. Please provide me with feedback at any time!\n\n\n\n\nStatistical & Computational Proficiency: Students will develop expertise and apply their knowledge in statistical analysis, probability, and computational concepts relevant to data science, including efficiency and data structures.\nApplication of Computational Methods: Students will demonstrate the ability to apply algorithmic, mathematical, and scientific reasoning to computational problems using a programming language.\nEthical Decision-Making: Students will understand and practice ethical philosophies and frameworks for data-driven decision-making and evaluating scientific claims.\nEffective Communication: Students will clearly and persuasively communicate data-driven analyses using literate programming and collaborate effectively with stakeholders across disciplines.\n\n\n\n\n\ncarry out a study and communicate results from an extensive data-driven project that is related to domain specific challenges; and\ndemonstrate competency in applying at least one type of advanced data-analytic method such as (not limited to):\n\nmodeling a process (e.g., generalized linear models, Bayesian analysis, advanced probability theory and stochastic processes, non-linear models, machine learning, big data analysis, econometrics, or statistical computing)\nadvanced study-design (e.g., creating a computational online study with sophisticated design to deal with non-independence)\nadvanced data visualization (e.g., creating a dashboard)\nadvanced computational data curation (e.g., scraping multiple websites and using regular expressions); and\n\nbe written with scripting code (i.e., not pull-down menus) using literate programming (data + code + results + narrative) and version control (e.g., GitHub);\ninclude a discussion of ethical issues that came up along with any solutions you used to address the ethical issues; and\nfocus on a question originating from or responding to a domain outside of statistics, mathematics, and computer science.\n\n\n\n\n(adapted from Monica Linden, Brown University):\nIn an ideal world, science would be objective. However, much of science is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of privileged voices. In this class, we will make an effort to recognize how science (and statistics!) has played a role in both understanding diversity as well as in promoting systems of power and privilege. I acknowledge that it is possible that there may be both overt and covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even though the material is primarily of a scientific nature. Integrating a diverse set of experiences is important for a more comprehensive understanding of science. I would like to discuss issues of diversity in statistics as part of the course from time to time.\nPlease contact me if you have any suggestions to improve the quality of the course materials.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records, please let me know!\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. You can also relay information to me via your mentors. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the math liaisons, Dean of Students, or QSC staff are all excellent resources. I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn class time will consist of two types of class sessions. Some of our class sessions will consist of working through the logistics surrounding your projects. For example, some days we will talk about the projects themselves, some days we will talk about how to turn in assignments, and some days you will be presenting. During 5 of our class sessions, we will talk about ethics in data science through the lens of a discipline (history, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and economics).\nThere is an expectation that you attend every class meeting and stay engaged in our discussions. On the ethical data science discussion days, you will have reading that you should do before coming to class.\n\n\n\n\nThe final data science capstone project is a written paper. During the semester, you will have parts of the paper due along the way. Ideally, when you get to the end of the semester, the written part will come naturally by putting together the parts from earlier in the semester. You should not leave all the writing to the end.\n\n\n\nThere will be expected reading on each of the five days when we discuss ethical data science. The readings will be posted on the front page of the course webpage. Some of the readings are hyper-linked. Others are available at the Claremont Colleges library, and you will need to login to the library to access the reading.\n\n\n\nYour final grade will be calculated using the following points system below. There are 120 total points. 90% of 120 is 108 points.\ntopic: 5pts\nannotated bibliography: 5pts\n1st outline: 5pts\nsection draft: 5pts\nintroduction or 2nd section: 5pts\nethics component: 5pts\nproject draft: 10pts\nfinal write-up: 25pts\n1st presentation: 10pts\n2nd presentation: 10pts\nfinal presentation: 25pts\nactive participation in ethics conversations: 10pts"

    "text": "Welcome to the Data Science Capstone Guidelines! This document serves to answer questions you have about the capstone course. Please reach out to Jo Hardin (jo.hardin@pomona.edu) with any questions.\n\n\nA required capstone project seminar in which senior data science minors focus their disciplinary curricular backgrounds (outside of statistics, mathematics, or computer science) on a sophisticated data science project. Professional skills developed include: ethics, project management, collaborative software development, documentation and consulting. Regular meetings, weekly progress reports, interim and final reports, and multiple presentations are required. Open only to Data Science minors. Prerequisites: DS002R (or equivalent), CSCI051 (or equivalent), MATH060, MATH058 (or equivalent), and data science ethics.\n\n\nthe 5 core courses must be completed by the end of the junior year in order to be eligible for the capstone course (fall only) which is taken in the fall of the senior year. The capstone course is PERM only. You must formally PERM the course (via course registration) and also fill out the PERM form which includes details of the courses you have taken as well as the structures in place to get the capstone up and running in September of the senior year.\n\n\n\n\nStatistical & Computational Proficiency: Students will develop expertise and apply their knowledge in statistical analysis, probability, and computational concepts relevant to data science, including efficiency and data structures.\nApplication of Computational Methods: Students will demonstrate the ability to apply algorithmic, mathematical, and scientific reasoning to computational problems using a programming language.\nEthical Decision-Making: Students will understand and practice ethical philosophies and frameworks for data-driven decision-making and evaluating scientific claims.\nEffective Communication: Students will clearly and persuasively communicate data-driven analyses using literate programming and collaborate effectively with stakeholders across disciplines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncarry out a study and communicate results from an extensive data-driven project that is related to domain specific challenges; and\ndemonstrate competency in applying at least one type of advanced data-analytic methods such as (not limited to):\n\nmodeling a process (e.g., generalized linear models, Bayesian analysis, advanced probability theory and stochastic processes, non-linear models, machine learning, big data analysis, econometrics, or statistical computing)\nadvanced study-design (e.g., creating a computational online study with sophisticated design to deal with non-independence)\nadvanced data visualization (e.g., creating a dashboard)\nadvanced computational data curation (e.g., scraping multiple websites and using regular expressions); and\n\nbe written with scripting code (i.e., not pull-down menus) using literate programming (data + code + results + narrative) and version control (e.g., GitHub);\ninclude a discussion of ethical issues that came up along with any solutions you used to address the ethical issues; and\nfocus on a question originating from or responding to a domain outside of statistics, mathematics, and computer science.\n\n\n\n\n\nOffered in fall semesters\nTaken in the student’s senior year\nIncludes close work with a faculty member with weekly meetings to discuss project\n~5 hours of work per week, outside of the course meeting time (as consistent with Pomona’s course credit definition)\nGrades will be assigned based on a combination of domain specific criteria and timely submission of assignments\n\n\n\n\n\nSpring junior year – have completed the 5 core requirements, PERM into capstone class for the following fall semester.\nFall senior year – complete the DS capstone project / course\nBy the end of the senior year – complete the additional elective course\n\n\n\n\n\nFind a faculty member who can support the project and provide domain expertise. The faculty member need not already be involved with Pomona’s Data Science minor, but you might be interested in which faculty members are affiliated with the minor.\n\nPro tip: ask the faculty mentor if you can help facilitate a project of theirs.\nPotential mentor might be in a non-academic office (e.g., sustainability, IIE, athletics, student health center, etc.)\n\nMeet with faculty mentor regularly. Identify resources on campus that can provide technical support.\nPerform the computational work required in the project.\nCommunicate the results of the project in writing and in a formal presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet with student regularly.\nMeet with other DS capstone periodically.\nFaculty mentors are not responsible for support outside of their expertise."
