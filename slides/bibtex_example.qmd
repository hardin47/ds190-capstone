# Introduction

Here is an introduction to my amazing capstone project. You will be impressed.

# Really important stuff

In the second chapter, I'll tell you some very important things. Indeed, my work is based on @tukey1972.

The important idea is the measure of a robust correlation [@tukey1972].


# Less important tuff

Although I read all about Halmos, I never ended up citing the work, so there is no in-text citation. Which means, you'll notice, that the Halmos citation does not show up in my references section even though Halmos is in the .bib file.

## To remember

If you use a reference, you should cite that work. In Quarto, the citation is done with the `@...` or `[@...]` format. If you do not cite a particular work, the reference will not show up in your references section, even if the entry is in your .bib file.
