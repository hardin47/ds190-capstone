## GitHub

You should be using GitHub to track all of your work

* Create a GitHub repo for your capstone project
* Public or Private + me + your advisor as collaborators
* Assignments should be well labeled, and the link to the assignment should be posted to Canvas

## Grading

Reasonable person test:  full credit if a reasonable person thinks that what you turned in is a _____  (e.g., a draft of section 1).

## Projects

The Data Science capstone project should: 

* carry out a study and communicate results from an extensive data-driven project that is related to domain specific challenges; and 
* demonstrate competency in applying at least one type of advanced data-analytic method such as (not limited to): 
   * modeling a process (e.g., generalized linear models, Bayesian analysis, advanced probability theory and stochastic processes, non-linear models, machine learning, big data analysis, econometrics, or statistical computing)
   * advanced study-design (e.g., creating a computational online study with sophisticated design to deal with non-independence)
   * advanced data visualization (e.g., creating a dashboard)
   * advanced computational data curation (e.g., scraping multiple websites and using regular expressions); and
* be written with scripting code (i.e., not pull-down menus) using literate programming (data + code + results + narrative) and version control (e.g., GitHub); 
* include a discussion of ethical issues that came up along with any solutions you used to address the ethical issues; and
* focus on a question originating from or responding to a domain outside of statistics, mathematics, and computer science.


## Student responsibilities:
* Find a faculty member who can support the project and provide domain expertise. The faculty member need not already be involved with Pomonaâ€™s Data Science minor, but you might be interested in which faculty members are affiliated with the minor.
* Meet with faculty mentor weekly.
* Identify resources on campus that can provide technical support.
* Perform the computational work required in the project.
* Communicate the results of the project in writing and in a formal presentation.



## Disciplinary Ethics in Data Science

* 5 class sessions for ethics conversations:  history, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, economics

* small amount of reading

* expectation for active participation in the conversation on those days
